# ðŸš€ Quick Deployment Guide for Netlify

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account
- Netlify account (free tier available)
- Git installed on your system

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Prepare Your Repository

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd study-hub

# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Complete Study Hub application"

# Create a new repository on GitHub and then:
git remote add origin <your-github-repo-url>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Deploy on Netlify

#### Option A: GitHub Integration (Recommended)

1. **Go to Netlify**
   - Visit https://app.netlify.com/
   - Sign up/Login with GitHub

2. **Create New Site**
   - Click "Add new site"
   - Select "Import an existing project"
   - Choose "Deploy with GitHub"
   - Authorize Netlify to access your GitHub

3. **Configure Build Settings**
   - Select your repository
   - Build settings should auto-detect:
     - **Base directory:** (leave empty)
     - **Build command:** `npm run build`
     - **Publish directory:** `dist`
   - Click "Deploy site"

4. **Wait for Deployment**
   - First deployment takes 2-3 minutes
   - You'll get a random URL like `random-name-123.netlify.app`

5. **Custom Domain (Optional)**
   - Go to Site settings â†’ Domain management
   - Click "Add custom domain"
   - Follow instructions to configure DNS

#### Option B: Drag & Drop (Quick Test)

1. **Build Locally**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy**
   - Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
   - Drag and drop the `dist` folder
   - Done! Site is live immediately

### 3. Continuous Deployment

With GitHub integration:
- Every push to `main` branch triggers automatic rebuild
- View deploy logs in Netlify dashboard
- Rollback to previous versions if needed

### 4. Environment Variables (For Future Use)

If you add backend or APIs later:
1. Go to Site settings
2. Build & deploy â†’ Environment variables
3. Add your variables (e.g., API keys)

## Build Configuration

The project includes:
- âœ… `netlify.toml` - Netlify configuration
- âœ… `public/_redirects` - SPA routing configuration
- âœ… Optimized build settings in `vite.config.js`

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check Node version (requires 14+)
- Ensure all dependencies are listed in `package.json`
- Review build logs in Netlify dashboard

### Routes Don't Work
- Verify `_redirects` file is in `public` folder
- Check `netlify.toml` configuration

### Styles Don't Load
- Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly installed
- Check PostCSS configuration
- Verify CSS imports in `main.jsx`
